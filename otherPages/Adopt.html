          <h4>Simba - Street Survivor to Family Protector</h4>
          <p>
            Simba was a stray dog found on the streets of Kathmandu, weak and
            fearful. After being adopted by a loving family through Tail of
            Hopes, Simba slowly gained confidence and became a loyal protector
            of his family. Today, he enjoys long walks and provides unwavering
            love and protection.
